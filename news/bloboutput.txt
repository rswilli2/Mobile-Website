Are you planning to use Carlyle Campbell Library books in the next three weeks?  Come get them now!<br><br>nnThe library is starting a project to make the ground floor a more inviting place to study and to make the collections of books on the ground floor easier to use.  To do this, we must first rearrange the book shelving on both the top and bottom floors of the library.  Between June 21 and July 12, many of the library's books will be relocated and only available if you ask a library staff member to get them for you.  Library staff will be happy to get books  from the construction area for you.  Library services on the main floor of the library (Information Services, Media Services, and Circulation) will be available as usual throughout the move.<br><br>nnConstruction work like this will also be noisy.  The construction workers plan to be in the library from 8am to 5pm each weekday until the project is completed.<br><br>nnAmong the changes we will make this summer are:<br>n*  Changing the way we shelve our remaining print journals and magazines--all print periodicals are now housed either on <br>compact shelving in the Carlyle Campbell Library or in the library's remote stacks building.<br>n*  Moving the education books (370-379) to the top floor of the library and to be shelved within the main collection.<br>n*  Adding shelving to the top floor of the library for those books.<br>n*  Moving the contents of the music library to the Carlyle Campbell Library ground floor.<br><br>nnMore changes will be made in the following year.  Talk to any library staff member to learn more about our plans for the ground floor.
